#Introduction

GEO provides a wealth of biology related data, and GPL570 (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) is one of the the most common biological chip platform.Although the post-processed matrix data are always provided, but the RAW data are most convincing!
Here we developed to deal GPL570 RAW.tar file using the robust multi-array average expression measure, and returns data frame which is expression profile.

#Usage

Load package.

```{r load-package, message=FALSE}
library(DealGPL570)
```

You can put your own `GSE*_RAW.tar` under the working directory.
First running this package, you need to keep your device online.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
file <- system.file("extdata", "GSE104683_RAW.tar", package = "DealGPL570")
result <- DealGPL570(file = file)
result[1:5, 1:3]
```

When type is "probeID"~

```{r, eval=FALSE}
result <- DealGPL570(file = file, type = "probeID")
result[1:5, 1:2]
```

And when type is "geneSymbol"~

```{r, eval=FALSE}
result <- DealGPL570(file = file, type = "geneSymbol")
result[1:5, 1:2]
```


## Details

For the gene symbols corresponding many probes, we take the median of those probes' expression values as the corresponding gene symbol's expression value.
